## Hercule — Your Fitness Chronicle

Hercule helps you log workouts fast, review progress at a glance, and build consistency with a clean, delightful experience.

### What you can do

- **See today at a glance**: The home screen shows your workout for today, with each exercise numbered and summarized by sets (e.g., "1. Bench Press — 60kg x 10-12"). If you haven’t trained yet, you’ll see a friendly prompt to start. One tap takes you to logging.
- **Log a workout in seconds**:
  - **Name your exercise**: Big, focused input at the top. Smart validation nudges you if you try to save without a name.
  - **Add sets quickly**: Tap “+ Enter Set” to add as many sets as you need.
  - **Pick reps and weight**: Use intuitive pickers for reps (1, 2, 3-4, 5-6, 7-8, …, 20+) and kilograms (0–200). No typing, no fuss.
  - **Copy a set**: Duplicate any set with one tap (handy for drop sets or repeat sets). The screen gently scrolls to your new set so you can keep momentum.
  - **Remove mistakes**: Delete any set instantly.
  - **Smooth, responsive feel**: Subtle animations make adding and organizing sets feel fluid.
